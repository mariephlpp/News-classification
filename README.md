* What is an RNN? 
* 
Deep neural networks usually assume independence between input and outputs. However, it isn't the case for RNN's. Indeed, an RNN has a "memory", it means that information are take from previous inputs to influence the next input and output within each sequence. 
In our case, to to address the problem of long-term dependencies we used
